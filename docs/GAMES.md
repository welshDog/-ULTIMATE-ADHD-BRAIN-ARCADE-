## 🌈 Stroop Challenge
**Target Skill:** Inhibition & Response Control

### How to Play
1.  A color word (e.g., "RED") appears on the screen.
2.  The word is printed in a specific ink color (e.g., Blue).
3.  **Your Goal:** Press the button that matches the **INK COLOR**, ignoring the word itself.
4.  **Example:** If you see the word "RED" printed in **BLUE** ink, click the **BLUE** button.

### Why it Works
This classic psychological task trains your brain to inhibit the automatic response (reading the word) and focus on the less dominant attribute (identifying the color). This strengthens the anterior cingulate cortex, which is involved in error monitoring and attention.

## 🧠 Dual N-Back Lite
**Target Skill:** Working Memory & Fluid Intelligence

### How to Play
1.  A grid is shown. In each turn, a square will light up.
2.  **Your Goal:** Determine if the *current* lit square is in the same position as the one shown **N steps ago**.
3.  **Levels:**
    *   **1-Back:** Match the position from the *previous* turn.
    *   **2-Back:** Match the position from *two* turns ago.
    *   **3-Back:** Match the position from *three* turns ago (Advanced!).

### Why it Works
N-Back tasks require you to hold information in your working memory while simultaneously processing new incoming information. It is one of the few cognitive tasks shown to improve fluid intelligence (problem-solving ability).
