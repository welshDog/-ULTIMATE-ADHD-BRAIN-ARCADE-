## üß† Special Dedication to the Neurodivergent Community

This project is created with love and dedication for the ADHD, AuDHD, and 
broader neurodivergent community. We believe that cognitive differences are 
strengths to be celebrated, not deficits to be "fixed."

Our mission is to provide free, accessible, evidence-based tools that help
neurodivergent minds thrive in a world designed for neurotypical brains.
