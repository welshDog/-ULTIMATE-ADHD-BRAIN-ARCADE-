## 🎯 **Development Guidelines**

### **🧠 ADHD-Friendly Code Style**
```javascript
// ✅ GOOD: Clear, descriptive names
function calculateWorkingMemoryScore(accuracy, reactionTime, difficulty) {
    const baseScore = accuracy * 100;
    const speedBonus = Math.max(0, 1000 - reactionTime);
    const difficultyMultiplier = 1 + (difficulty * 0.2);
    
    return Math.round(baseScore * difficultyMultiplier + speedBonus);
}

// ❌ AVOID: Cryptic abbreviations
function calcWMScore(acc, rt, diff) {
    return Math.round(acc * 100 * (1 + diff * 0.2) + Math.max(0, 1000 - rt));
}
```
